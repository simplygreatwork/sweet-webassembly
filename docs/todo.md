- when freeing structures - need to be able to free substructures
- when compacting memory - compact first page then fill in the end from higher pages 
- remove legend.wat
- recreate array.wat as a handle based array
- store id (handle id) with every structure created
	- this way can update pointer from handle id when moving a structure during compaction
	- allow memory_allocate_handle to do this automatically
- implement ranges for available handle id reuse (for gaps)
- implement array inside core - but expose core module's array in array module
- gracefully handle out of memory when allocating
	- with transactions ?

- use preprocessor for types mapping (implemented)
- $tree_insert needs to be able to update values
- (string "result: ") does not parse
- tree should become map
- function type
- also be able to name functions using a string - as parameter to function object
- streams (source, sink)
- source will push, sink will collect
- stream will simply pipe
- reclaim / deallocate / compact memory
- garbage collection scheme
- write wasm to disk to load in browser
- run without compiling
- array join: for easy string creation
- flesh out list and map (use tree)
- sorting algorithm
- binary search tree (implemented)
- more methods for number/boolean/list/string
- vector as a list of arrays
- implement vector as a binary search tree not a list
- create array module
- how to disallow null/undefined
- implement message passing but without inheritance
- compare two strings (done)
- sort a list, array, or vector
- use a map to create a type id map (types.wat.watm)
- ensure to use property access helper functions e.g. see string and string_length
- potential issue: string equals loop may assume minimum length of 1
- implement string_equals in terms of string_compare (done)
- integrate string_compare into tree nodes (done)
- implement comparators into tree insertion
- integrate tree into map (no: tree will become map)
